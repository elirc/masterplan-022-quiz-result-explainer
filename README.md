# M022 — Quiz Result Explainer

A learner needs to see why each answer was marked correct without rewriting the question bank.

This is a complete small **reference implementation and learning workshop** for MASTERPLAN builds M011–M025. Study the choices, then make your own variation. The reference is finished; the exercises and your journal are deliberately unfinished.

**Main skill:** Derived values and identity. **Study pairing:** existing curriculum #31, [react](https://github.com/elirc/react). [Previous](https://github.com/elirc/masterplan-021-theme-token-sandbox) · [Next](https://github.com/elirc/masterplan-023-import-preview-tray)

## Run it

Use Git and Node.js 22 or newer. There are no package dependencies to install.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/elirc/masterplan-022-quiz-result-explainer.git
cd masterplan-022-quiz-result-explainer
npm test
npm start
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:4300 and leave the terminal running. Stop with Ctrl+C. Run one project at a time, or use a different PORT for a second server. On PowerShell: `$env:PORT=4301` before `npm start`. The preview serves only public/ on your own computer. For the React builds, npm start first builds the JSX source into an ignored local bundle.

`private: true` in package.json prevents accidental npm publication; it does not make this GitHub repository private. The GitHub repository is intended to be public.

## What the reference promises

Five fixed questions have stable IDs, choices and explanations. Answers are stored by question ID; score and per-question statuses are derived from current answers. Unanswered questions count as skipped, separately from chosen incorrect answers. Reversing display order preserves the meaning of every answer. Editing an answer clears the old result until resubmission; unknown question IDs in an answer object do not create extra score rows.

The source named react is actually vanilla JavaScript; this build stays vanilla and isolates result explanations.

## Read in this order

1. [Learning route](docs/00-START-HERE.md): a manageable session plan and readiness check.
2. [Build walkthrough](docs/01-BUILD-WALKTHROUGH.md): build from requirements to the smallest verified result.
3. [Concepts and execution traces](docs/02-CONCEPTS-AND-TRACES.md): predict, trace and explain the real code.
4. [Code tour and architecture choices](docs/03-CODE-TOUR.md): exact files and responsibilities.
5. [Debugging laboratory](docs/04-DEBUGGING-LAB.md): one worked diagnosis and two guided investigations.
6. [Six learner stories](docs/05-PRACTICE-STORIES.md): features and fixes with plans, acceptance criteria and decisions left to you.
7. [Hints and answer directions](docs/06-HINTS-AND-ANSWERS.md): consult after an attempt.
8. [Agentic coaching prompts](docs/07-AGENTIC-COACHING.md): ask for help without outsourcing the learning.
9. [Build journal and decision narrative](docs/08-BUILD-JOURNAL.md): a retrospective explanation grounded in the actual implementation.
10. [Verification](docs/VERIFICATION.md) and [blank journal](docs/JOURNAL-TEMPLATE.md).

## Know what the checks prove

npm test runs the pure JavaScript boundary regressions. Browser evidence separately covers form interaction, error recovery, layout and keyboard entry.

This is a local educational example with fictional content. There is no production deployment, external data integration, tracking, authentication or payment flow. Do not mistake the deliberately small scope for a template that already solves those additional concerns.

## Your first independent task

Add a clear-one-answer action: Delete one answer key and rerender its radio group without touching other answers. Read its acceptance criteria, create a practice branch, and write your prediction before changing code. Keep your personal notes in `my-journal/`, which is ignored by Git.

## Expanded upskilling edition

[Open the expanded workshop map](docs/WORKBOOK-INDEX.md). The original companion is now supplemented by twelve substantial chapters, **15 total practice stories**, twelve saved coaching prompts, guided rebuild sessions, deeper debugging cases, test-design exercises, repeated recall and a twelve-session personal journal.

Start with one route: foundations if syntax is unfamiliar; one story if you can trace the reference; review and test design if you have already made a change. The reference code is unchanged. New features and journal entries remain your work to complete.
