# M022: deeper debugging casebook

[Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md) · [Repository overview](../README.md)

The incidents below are hypothetical teaching scenarios based on realistic mistakes in this codebase. They are not claims that the shipped reference is broken. Reproduce a proposed defect only on a disposable practice branch. Keep an observed failure separate from a likely explanation; the point of an experiment is to make those two agree or disagree.

## Incident 1: An answer moves to a different question after reverse

**Fictional report:** A learner says, “An answer moves to a different question after reverse.” They supply no diagnosis. Your job is to reduce the report to a reproducible difference from the contract.

**Candidate defect for the lab:** Key answers by rendered array index.

**Starting experiment:** Answer identity, reverse the list, then submit.

### Triage before touching the code

Record the exact input or content, the action, the expected result and the actual result. Check whether you are running the file or branch you think you are running. A browser may be showing an older served directory; a terminal may be in a different repository. Confirm the environment using ordinary read-only inspection before changing a product rule.

The relevant promise is: Five fixed questions have stable IDs, choices and explanations. Answers are stored by question ID; score and per-question statuses are derived from current answers. Unanswered questions count as skipped, separately from chosen incorrect answers. Reversing display order preserves the meaning of every answer. Editing an answer clears the old result until resubmission; unknown question IDs in an answer object do not create extra score rows. Extract only the sentence this incident violates. Do not rewrite the whole contract to fit an accidental result. If the reported behavior is outside scope, document that first; an unsupported case is not automatically a regression.

### Keep two hypotheses alive

Hypothesis A: the owning rule near `scoreQuiz` is wrong. Hypothesis B: the rule is correct but `public/app.js` supplies or presents the wrong value or state. Name the observation each hypothesis predicts.

Use the smallest controlled experiment that makes the predictions differ. Reading more files is not always a better experiment. A single exact boundary value, a changed call order or a computed style can be more decisive than a large random fixture. Record the outcome before making the repair.

### Locate the causal boundary

public/app.js and core.js: use question.id at storage and lookup.

Explain why this location can produce the symptom. A line near the visible error is not necessarily the cause; the wrong value may have been produced earlier. Conversely, a plausible architectural theory is weak if the actual event handler never reaches the suspected function. Follow one trace end to end rather than searching for a fashionable anti-pattern.

### Repair narrowly and look for neighboring damage

Make the smallest coherent repair that restores the contract. Rerun the discriminating example, then one ordinary neighboring case and one recovery or repeat sequence. If the repair only special-cases the chosen fixture, propose a second input that exposes that weakness. A regression should preserve the reason for the fix, not merely the exact spelling of one fixture.

### Write a short incident note

Use these fields: symptom; violated promise; competing hypotheses; experiment; actual observation; owning rule; repair; regression; remaining uncertainty. Avoid claiming the hypothetical incident happened in the original build history. The supplied narrative is a practice route; your own note should describe only the experiment you actually performed.

**After a break:** explain “An answer moves to a different question after reverse” again without opening the location hint. If you can recall only the file name, repeat the input-to-output trace. The useful memory is the causal relationship, not where a previous assistant told you to click.

## Incident 2: First choices are marked skipped

**Fictional report:** A learner says, “First choices are marked skipped.” They supply no diagnosis. Your job is to reduce the report to a reproducible difference from the contract.

**Candidate defect for the lab:** Use a truthiness test for choice instead of undefined.

**Starting experiment:** Select option zero for identity.

public/core.js: zero is a valid choice index.

## Incident 3: The old score stays visible after an edit

**Fictional report:** A learner says, “The old score stays visible after an edit.” They supply no diagnosis. Your job is to reduce the report to a reproducible difference from the contract.

**Candidate defect for the lab:** Remove result invalidation from onchange.

**Starting experiment:** Score, change an answer and inspect the old explanation.

### Locate the causal boundary

public/app.js: result validity depends on the current answer map.

Explain why this location can produce the symptom. A line near the visible error is not necessarily the cause; the wrong value may have been produced earlier. Conversely, a plausible architectural theory is weak if the actual event handler never reaches the suspected function. Follow one trace end to end rather than searching for a fashionable anti-pattern.

## When a proposed repair fails

Stop adding edits. Compare the new symptom with the old one and inspect the diff. Decide whether the experiment rejected your hypothesis or whether the repair failed to change the intended boundary. Revert only your own experimental change if needed, preserve other work, and try the next discriminating input.
